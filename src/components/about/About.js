              I am able to solve complex logic or other tasks related to web
              development. I have a perfect understanding of how JavaScript,
              TypeScript, HTML, and CSS work. I have a lot of experience working
              with up-to-date technologies especially React JS. I have powerful
              knowledge HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
              ES6, TypeScript, ReactJS, NextJS, React Native, Redux, NodeJS,
              NPM, ExpressJS, MongoDB, PostMan, Webpack, Firebase, Figma, XD.

              My favorite in this programming sector is to fix any Errors.
              Because in every error there is hope to learn something new. I
              won't quit until I can fix the error. In this programming life, I
              have tried to solve all kinds of problems and have succeeded. My
              policy is to stick with it until the problem is solved.
